# Code purpose: DRIVING BY COLOR TRACKING WITH CLOSED-LOOP STEERING CONTROL
#   This program captures an image, discovers a target within your HSV range
#   Generates a pixel location of the target, and estimates the angle of the
#   target from the camera's centerline (x-y plane) called ThetaOffset.
